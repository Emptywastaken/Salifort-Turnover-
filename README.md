# Saliprot Employee retention 

## Project Overview
This project aims to determine key factors that affect employee turnover and build a model that predicts whether an employee will leave the company. The final random forest model was performed with 98.6% accuracy and 99.1% precision determining the most important features in identifying employees who are likely to leave. 

## Business Understanding 
The company invests in recruiting and training for each employee. A high turnover rate is causing extra expenses, thus it is important to determine underlying reasons for employees leaving.

## Data Understanding 
The data consisted of approximately 12k unique(there were duplicated entries) employee evaluations and 10 features. The features included employee satisfaction, efficiency evaluation, amount of hours per month, tenure, number of concurrent projects, department, and salary range. 16.7% of employees in the dataset left the company.

## Steps performed:
- Exploratory data analysis
- Building & tuning machine learning model (decision tree, random forest, XGBoost)
- Cross-validation
- Creating visualizations
- Model results evaluation

## Results:
- The random forest model performed best on the test data showing an F1 score of 95.6%, a precision score of 99.1%, a recall of 92.4%, and an AUC score of 96.1%. **Overall model accuracy of 98.6%.**
- Insight derived based on built models and EDA results.
- Determined a set of key features that are influential to employee turnover.
- Created a set of visualizations to explain model performance and key features better
- Created executive summary
