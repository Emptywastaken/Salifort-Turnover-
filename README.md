# Saliprot Employee retention capstone project for Google Advanced Data Analytics specialization

## Project Overview
This project aims to determine key factors that affect employee turnover and build a model that predicts whether an employee will leave the company. This project utilized yellow taxi trips taken in New York City during 2017. The final random forest model was performed with 98.6% accuracy and 99.1% precision determining the most important features in identifying employees who will likely leave. 

## Business Understanding 
The company invests in recruiting and training for each employee. A high turnover rate is causing extra expenses, thus it is important to determine underlying reasons for employees leaving.

## Data Understanding 
Saiip
. The data consisted of approximately 408k unique trips and 18 features. The features included information on trip duration and destination, vendor used, toll information, and payment type. The bar chart below shows the breakdown of how many generous tippers (>20%) versus non-generous tippers that exist in the data set. 

## Step performed:
- Exploratory data analysis
- Building & tuning machine learning model (decision tree, random forest, XGBoost)
- Cross-validation
- Creating visualizations
- Model results evaluation

## Results:
- The random forest model performed best on the test data showing an F1 score of 95.6%, a precision score of 99.1%, a recall of 92.4%, and an AUC score of 96.1%. **Overall model accuracy of 98.6%.**
- Insight derived based on built models and EDA results.
- Determined a set of key features that are influential to employee turnover.
- Created a set of visualizations to explain model performance and key features better
- Created executive summary
